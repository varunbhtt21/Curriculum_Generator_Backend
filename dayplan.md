- Explain the basic syntax of JavaScript, including statements and comments.
- Discuss the importance of variables in JavaScript and their role in storing and manipulating data.
- Demonstrate the process of declaring and initializing variables in JavaScript.
- Provide coding examples and encourage learners to practice declaring variables on their own.

Activity 1: Variable Practice Exercise (15 minutes):
- Provide a set of exercises that require learners to declare and use variables in JavaScript.
- Encourage learners to solve the exercises individually and provide assistance as needed.
- Discuss the solutions and clarify any doubts or misconceptions.

Sub-objective 2: JavaScript data types and operators (15 minutes):

- Provide coding examples and encourage learners to practice writing conditional statements and loops.

Activity 2: E-commerce Scenario (15 minutes):
- Present a hypothetical e-commerce scenario and ask learners to apply their JavaScript knowledge.
- Challenge learners to incorporate variables, data types, operators, and conditional statements in solving the scenario.
- Provide guidance and support as learners work on their solutions.
- Discuss the different approaches taken by learners and highlight best practices.

Conclusion (5 minutes):
- Summarize the key points covered in the session, including JavaScript syntax, variables, data types, operators, conditional statements, and loops.
- Reiterate the importance of JavaScript in web development, especially in the context of e-commerce.
- Encourage learners to practice and further explore JavaScript on their own.

Additional resources:
- Provide a list of recommended websites, tutorials, and books for learners to explore JavaScript further.
