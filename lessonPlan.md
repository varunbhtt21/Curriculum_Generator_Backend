Thank you for providing the course details. However, there are some fields that still need clarification. To generate a customized curriculum plan, I would need the following information:

1. Course Subject: Please specify the subject or topic of the course. This could be a programming language, framework, or any other specific area of expertise.

2. Specific Course Goals: Please provide details regarding the specific goals or outcomes you expect from this course. Examples could include skill enhancement in a particular area or preparation for a specific job role.

3. Prior Knowledge: Please specify any prior knowledge or prerequisites that participants should have before enrolling in the course. This could include specific programming languages, concepts, or technologies.

Once I have the answers to these questions, I will be able to generate a customized curriculum plan for the one-week Outcome-Based course targeting experienced professionals.
